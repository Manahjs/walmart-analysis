# walmart-analysis
it compltelly pyhon project with data analyst and time forcasting AR MODEL to predict the sales for the next month with fine tunned process
# A. Analyze the performance of sales and revenue at the city and branch level
# B. Average price of an item sold at each branch of the city
# C. Analyze the performance of sales and revenue, Month-over-Month across the Product line, Gender, and Payment Method
# Identifying Focus Areas for Better Sales in April 2019
For this, sinGroup data by City and Branch.
Calculate Total Sales: This counts the number of transactions (Invoice IDs).
Calculate Total Revenue: Revenue is calculated as the sum of Unit price * Quantity for each city and branch.ce you need to focus on improvements in April, we will first calculate data for March and April and compare them:

#  part of some Sample Output :
The output will show the total number of sales (transactions) and the total revenue for each city and branch.

Example output might look like:

City	Branch	Total_Sales	Total_Revenue
Mandalay	A	150	25000.50
Naypyitaw	B	200	40000.75
Yangon	C	650	85000.90

# To visualize the Month-over-Month performance of sales and revenue across Product Line, Gender, and Payment Method, we can use the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create plots

# First Plot (Sales):

X-axis: Month
Y-axis: Total Sales (number of transactions)
Hue: Product Line (different lines will represent different product categories)
Style: Gender (different markers for Male/Female)
Second Plot (Revenue):

X-axis: Month
Y-axis: Total Revenue
Hue: Payment Method (different lines for Cash, Ewallet, etc.)
Style: Gender (Male/Female differences shown with markers)

# pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
# import pandas as pd 
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# import seaborn as sns 

Data Aggregation:

Aggregates total sales and revenue for the first three months and April.
Merges these aggregates to compare sales and revenue.
Gap Calculation:

Computes gaps for both sales and revenue.
Visualizations:

Bar Plots:
Sales Gap: Shows the difference in total sales between the first three months and April.
Revenue Gap: Shows the difference in total revenue between the first three months and April.
Pie Charts:
Sales Distribution: Shows the distribution of total sales by payment method for April.
Revenue Distribution: Shows the distribution of total revenue by payment method for April.
By running this code, you should get clear bar plots showing gaps in sales and revenue, and pie charts illustrating the distribution of sales and revenue by payment method for April

# using time forcasting to analysis and predict the data for next month
Load and Prepare Data: Ensure the dataset is properly loaded and processed.
Use AR Model: Fit an AR model to the data and make predictions.
Plot Results: Visualize the forecasts.

# Data Preprocessing: Sorting and setting the index to Month for time series analysis.
# ACF Plot: Helps determine the appropriate lag for the AR model.
# Model Building: Using AutoReg to fit the AR model.
# Model Evaluation: Calculating MAE and RMSE to assess model accuracy.
# Forecast Plot: Visualizing predictions against actual data.

# This code helps in understanding the patterns in product sales using the MA model, visualizes the sales patterns (ACF), forecasts future sales, and evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy.
